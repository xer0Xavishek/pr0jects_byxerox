This script does the following:

It defines the target file extension, encrypted file extension, ransom note filename, and ransom amount.

The encrypt_file function takes a file path and encryption key, encrypts the file using AES encryption, and saves the encrypted data to a new file with the .encrypted extension. It then deletes the original file.

The decrypt_file function takes an encrypted file path and the encryption key, decrypts the file, and saves the decrypted data to a new file with the original extension. It then deletes the encrypted file.

In the main function, a random 16-byte encryption key is generated.

It iterates over files with the target extension, encrypts each file, and deletes the original file.

It creates a ransom note file demanding a ransom payment in Bitcoin and providing instructions.

After the ransom is paid (you need to implement your own payment verification logic), it decrypts the encrypted files using the same encryption key.
